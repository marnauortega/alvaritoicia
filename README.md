(Live Site)[https://marnauortega.github.io/alvaritoicia/]

Website for the circus show Somnis. I did the design, branding, copywrighting and development of the site. It's a simple responsive site built plainly in HTML, CSS and a bit of JS.
This was my first coding project and I was proud of the result.
